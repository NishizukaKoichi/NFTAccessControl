# NFTAccessControl

An Ethereum-based access control system using NFT ownership verification.

## Description

NFTAccessControl is a decentralized application (dApp) that leverages the Ethereum blockchain to enable access control based on NFT (Non-Fungible Token) ownership. This innovative system allows web administrators to restrict access to certain web pages or resources to users who own specific NFTs. By integrating blockchain technology, NFTAccessControl verifies NFT ownership in real-time, ensuring a secure and transparent way to manage access rights.

## Features

- **NFT Ownership Verification**: Utilizes smart contracts to securely verify if a user owns a specific NFT, providing a robust method of access control.
- **Dynamic Access Control**: Enables web administrators to specify which NFTs grant access to particular resources, offering flexible and dynamic access management.
- **Ethereum Integration**: Built on the Ethereum blockchain for enhanced security and decentralized control.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers a straightforward web interface that prompts users to connect their Ethereum wallet for NFT verification.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed.
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or another Ethereum wallet browser extension installed.
- Ethereum testnet (e.g., Rinkeby) tokens for deploying the smart contract.

### Configuration

Ensure the web server is configured to serve `index.html`. This will be the entry point for users to interact with the NFTAccessControl system.

## Usage

1. Users visit the web page and are prompted to connect their Ethereum wallet.
2. The web application verifies if the connected wallet owns the required NFT.
3. Access is granted if the user owns the specified NFT; otherwise, they are redirected to a page where they can purchase the NFT
